### How to Use

The easiest way is to click the handy "launch binder" button above! That will launch a new window in your browser with a live version of the notebook file up and running for you to view, run, edit, and re-run to your heart's content.

Alternatively, you can `git clone` this repository to run the notebook yourself. Just make sure you have all the prerequisites installed, courtesy of the included `environment.yml` file (check out [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) for details).
